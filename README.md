# zipfsLaw
Simulation of random and non-random word selection to exemplify zipfs law - Paretto distribution.


## Currently done

* random selection of words
* animation
* normalization of plot
* markers for Zipfs law (discrete Paretto distribution)

## ToDo

* Continuous simulation (play, pause, reset)
* input simulation step
* input probability increase
* status of calculations
* stats of number of words and etc
* import of user text
* p-value for being a Paretto distribution
* deviation from theoretical distribution coefficient
* tooltip with number of counts for each
